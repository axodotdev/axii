# Contributing

Thanks so much for your interest in contributing to `axii`.

## Response Times

- `axii` is an offering from a company, so maintenance and responses will
  be largely constrained to employee workdays, (generally Mon-Thu Europe/US
  timezones)
- `axii` is not part of axo's core functionality so maintenance and response
  times may take a back seat to other projects and be delayed as a result

## Issues

All contributions should start with an issue, whether they're bugs or feature
requests! Please use the issue template that best matches your situation.

## Pull Requests

When making a PR please consider the following:
- Please file an issue before a PR to help ensure your efforts are aligned
  with the project's goals and likely to be accepted
- Existing lints and tests should pass before you request a review
- If you add functionality or fix a bug, please add a test that covers it

## Interaction Expectations

We expect folks to treat each other and the axo team with dignity and respect.
Any time someone fails to meet this expectation, we will endeavor to
communicate the specific issue and give the person an opportunity to apologize
and repair the interaction.

In extreme cases, we reserve the right to close and delete any associated
communication. In cases where expectations are repeatedly not met, we reserve
the right to limit the person's interaction with this or any of axo's repos,
including but not limited to banning them indefinitely.

If you have any issues or concerns, please reach out to [hello@axo.dev].
